# Launchpad Of Shapes
2019

### Project description
This project took place at Universidade de Coimbra in my Master's in Computer Engineering.

### The idea

So, my group had the idea of making some sort of game that isn't really a game for Autistic children in order to help them develop their cognitive senses.
The inicial idea was basically touching random parts of the screen and different effects would appear, either visual or musical, such as shapes, some other kind of draggable effect, sounds or actual.
The important part about this project was to allow the children to be creative at the same time they are having fun in a simplistic way.

### The Development

First we made research about autistic children including an interview to a mother of an autistic teenager, and we learned that they are used to tecnology in their everyday life. Knowing that, we continued with the original idea, which we first passed on to paper, simulating the digital environment, so we could see prior to making it how it would look.
From there, my group "disappeared" and i was left to do everything alone.

### My part
I chose Unity to make this "game", because it was the development environment i was most confortable with. I already knew what needed to be done, so i started looking for different kinds of effects that i could use and i found some really interesting. I combined drag effects with shapes in a sort of launch-pad with 3 options of creating even more shapes than those that are already available freely.
While developing the "game", i realised that i could divide it into two. What i mean is, i could separate the sound effects into two vertents. One where each click is one sound or each click is a musical sequence. One of these requires more creativity while the other is more of a enjoyable environment where each touch is a different musical exerpt.

### Tech && Methodologies

Unity, C#, Inkscape.
