# Launchpad Of Shapes
2019

### Project description
This project took place at Universidade de Coimbra in my Master's in Computer Engineering.

### The idea

So i had the idea of making some sort of lauchpad that not only allows the user to create music, but also create some shapes and effects while doing it.
Basically the user only had to touch random parts of the screen, where buttons lie and different effects would appear accordingly.

### The Development

Firstly, the idea was written down on paper, simulating the digital environment, so i could see prior to making it how it should look. I started by defining the background color and lay down buttons along it. From there i searched up free sounds to use and created two vertents of the project:
  ## Vertent 1:
    -Each click produces a single sound, allowing for greater creativity from the user
  ## Vertent 2:
    -Each click produces an excerpt of music, which allows the user to immerse better on each touch
    
After having all sounds worked on, i started looking for different kinds of effects that could be used, and i found some really interesting ones. I combined drag effects with shapes, sorta looking like a shooting star that is draggable.
Apart from those shapes, i created a menu in the bottom part of the launchpad to allow the user to create shapes on demand. The menu allows the user to create Squares, Triangles, Rectangles and Circles on top of the buttons.
In order for the buttons not to be all covered by the shape the user creates, the drag effect ones dissapear when the user lets go of his finger, and the menu ones disappear by gravity, leaving a clear work station or FUN STATION.

### Tech && Methodologies

Unity, C#, Inkscape.
